# Marvelous Memory

This project is a browser-based game to challenge your memory skills. It allows you to build a memory game by choosing your favorite characters from the Marvel Comics Universe (TM).

## Features:
- Integration with the Marvel Comics API to find characters and imagery.
- Use of `@mmenavas/memory-game-builder`  as the engine for the memory game boards.
- Use of tailwind for quick styling work.

## Roadmap:
- Improve logic to detect mistakes (e.g. if I open a new card, and then open a previously revealed card that does not match the new card, that should be counted as a mistake).
- Additional CSS work to beautify the game.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
